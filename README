A sample program demonstrating how to read and play music in Music Library on iOS device through FMOD system.Before compiling this project, you need to:1. Install FMOD.	FMOD ExProgrammersAPI for iOS is available at http://www.fmod.org/index.php/download#FMODExProgrammersAPI2. Set "Header Search Path" and "Library Search Path" properly for FMOD.The core logic of creating a temporary audio buffer and feed it to the audio callback is based onNick Collins' Music LibraryRemoteIODemo sample.http://www.informatics.sussex.ac.uk/users/nc81/code.html
